## Our application relies on the following dependencies:
1. Flask — this is the web server that we’ll use
2. Flask-SQLAlchemy — an ORM that makes it easier for us to communicate with our SQL database
3. Ariadne — a library for GraphQL python integration
4. Flask-Cors — an extension for Cross Origin Resource Sharing
